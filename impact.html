    <h1>An event that made a positive impact on me is</h1>

    <p>
        when I realized I could talk to my friends about anime. So for a little background I really only found a group
        of friends to hang out with in 5th grade, so I was pretty new to the whole friends thing. Then, in 6th grade I
        startd to watch anime, mostly because of my sister and I also sort of knew my friends watched Naruto but that
        was about it. My first anime was Noragami and I binged it on kissanime, still one of my favorites because of it.
        Over the summer I would watch tons of series, like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Assassination Classroom, Haruhi Suzumiya, and Code Geass. When 7th grade came
        around I was a full blown anime fan. I started talking about anime to one of my friends and I was able to get
        him to watch anime and we would talk/text about it for hours.
